## Introduction to Python

A collection of scripts, written by me, to meet some learning objectives.

### Scripts Included

Each one of the following scripts, when ran, will do different things. 

`ITS320_CTA1_Option2.py`: Takes two inputs, transforms the input to integers, then does three different types of division. Output of the script will contain regular, float, and modulo.
