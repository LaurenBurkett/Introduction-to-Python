## Introduction to Python

A collection of scripts, written by me, to meet some learning objectives.

### Scripts Included

Each one of the following scripts, when ran, will do different things. 

`ITS320_CTA1_Option2.py`: Takes two inputs, transforms the input to integers, then does three different types of division. Output of the script will contain regular, float, and modulo.

`ITS320_CTA2_Option2.py`: Takes make, model, year, odometer readings, and MPG of user. Prints information into a string and computes amount of gasoline used on a specific trip. 

`ITS320_CTA3_Option1.py`: Takes year range of Ferrari 250 GTO and calulate the value based on model year.   

`ITS320_CTA4_Option2.py`: Takes input from user of 5 grades and then compiles the data to determine the average, minimum, and maximum grades. This program is wrapped in a while loop with prompts for the user to run the porgram again or exit.

`ITS320_CTA5_Option1.py`: Takes input from user for three strings. Method will return to the user a concatanation of the string values in reverse order. 

`ITS320_CTA6_Option2.py`: Takes user input and creates the Cartesian output for the lists. Integer list does not go over 10. 

`ITS_302_PP_Final_Program.py`: Dictionary for car dealership to list inventory, add, delete, and update the information.
